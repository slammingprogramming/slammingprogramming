# Code of Conduct for My Profile Repository

## Our Commitment

I am committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all visitors to my profile. This document outlines my expectations for participant behavior and the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Standards

To ensure a positive experience for everyone, I expect participants to adhere to the following principles:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone with kindness and respect. Value different perspectives and experiences.

4. **No Harassment**: Harassment of any kind, including comments that are offensive, threatening, or discriminatory, will not be tolerated. This includes personal attacks, unwanted contact, or any behavior that creates an intimidating environment.

5. **Focus on Ideas**: Discussions should remain relevant to the profile and its content. Personal issues or off-topic discussions may be redirected to a more appropriate venue.
