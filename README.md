### Hi there, I'm Ashtin (aka @slammingprogramming) 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a passionate game and software developer with a strong foundation in radio/wireless, chemistry, physics, space, and tech.

Justice and integrity are at the core of my values, and I’m eager to connect with potential employers, collaborators, and the vibrant open-source community.

#### About Me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning new languages, both spoken and programming, to broaden my skill set.
- 🔭 I’m constantly exploring low-level programming, such as ASM, to gain a deeper understanding of how software interacts with hardware.
- 🚀 I'm always on the lookout for interesting and niche projects that challenge me and align with my interests.
- 💡 I'm enthusiastic about contributing to the open-source ecosystem and collaborating with like-minded developers.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid advocate for the right to repair and believe in empowering individuals to take control of their own technology.

#### My Passions

- 🎮 Gaming: I'm passionate about gaming and its potential as a storytelling medium and a platform for immersive experiences. I enjoy exploring game mechanics, designing game worlds, and creating memorable gameplay moments.

- 🖥️ Technology for Good: I strongly believe in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and advance humanity's goals. I'm interested in projects that have a positive impact, such as those related to education, healthcare, and sustainability.

#### Fun Fact

Once, while modifying an Xbox 360 for security research, I was convinced I had nailed the process after eight long hours. Just as I was ready to celebrate my success, I reassembled it and... pop! One tiny, too-short wire pulled a trace, and just like that, my beloved console was a brick. I was so upset I went to bed, but when I woke up, I decided to give it another shot. I bought a new 360 for $20 and, in just 30 minutes, got it right the second time! Lesson learned: patience is key, especially when dealing with tech!
